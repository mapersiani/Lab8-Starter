Q: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

A: Graceful degradation is the process of starting from the top (building something advanced) and working down to ensure that the website/project/task/etc. works for older devices, browser versions, and those with accessibility needs. This way, the core functionality remains intact even if some features are not supported. Since service workers allow the use of a website without an internet connection, we can see that it is related to graceful degradation. Service workers enhance offline functionality and enable an application to function fully offline instead of just displaying an offline message or crashing. Additionally, in a situation where the internet connection is poor, service workers can cache requests to improve the website's performance.
